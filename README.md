# Learn2Cook

Is a full stack application that draws inspiration from New York Times Cooking and Netflix. 

As more and more people are learning to be more experimental in their culinary prowess, there should be a website that is dedicated to those who are just starting out to learn. Users can look at recipes, read and leave reviews, as well as favoriting what they love to make, for easier access to them!
